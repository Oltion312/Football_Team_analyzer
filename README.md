What i did in the 2021 Studentweek it was working with python and ubuntu, that helped me analyze how many wins, loses and draws some Premier League Teams have performed in the past years. It  was pretty awsome how the computer did things you command. For exaple if i wanted to install a program named "pip" i had to write this: sudo apt install pip. 

Usage example: 
oltion@oltion-VirtualBox:~$ python3 olti_fifa_2.py
